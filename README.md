# Objective-C KVO and Weak References: Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) in Objective-C when using weak references. The bug arises from the interaction between KVO and the memory management system, leading to unexpected behavior and potential crashes.

## Bug Description

The core issue lies in the scenario where an object observes a property of another object using a weak reference. If the observed object is deallocated while the observation is still in place, a crash can occur. This happens because the KVO mechanism might still try to access the deallocated object.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing the KVO observation lifecycle.  It's crucial to remove the observer before the observed object is deallocated. We can do this using `removeObserver:forKeyPath:` before the object goes out of scope or we can rely on the `dealloc` method.  This ensures that KVO doesn't attempt to access the released memory.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Build and run the project. Observe the output in the console. 
3. See the `bug.m` file for the buggy implementation and `bugSolution.m` for the corrected version.
